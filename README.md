# README Generator

## Description
My project is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user’s input using the Inquirer package.
When creating open source projects on GitHub, it is important to have a high-quality README for the app. As a developer I want a generator to quickly create a professional README for a new project. 
The problem that the generator will solve is the speeding up of a repetitive task that is necessary for all projects. The requirements for a good readme are easily repeatable with some amendments to the basic content. 
In creating this generator, I have been able to learn more about NODE.js, JavaScript techniques and begin to experience the back end of coding. 
Hopefully, my project will stand out by my use of inquirer. The first commit for this application will be a basic working generator that will input the data through a basic overview of the npm Inquirer package. I hope to investigate it’s features and produce a more dynamic README file.
